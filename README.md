# HOW TO USE

Clone this github repository to your local machine.

First, create a new file in your root directory of this app called .env. Put the following line in

API_KEY="YOUR API KEY" (replacing YOUR API KEY with your API key for the YouTube data API)

Run the following commands:

`npm i`

`cd client`

`npm i` 

`cd ..`

`npm run dev`

The app should then open in your browser. If it is not working, make sure you have node.js updated to the latest version. If you have any questions, message me for help.
